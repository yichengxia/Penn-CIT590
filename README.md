# Penn-CIT590
This is my CIT590 (Programming Languages and Techniques) homework projects in 2021 fall.

## HW2: Supermarket
This is a supermarket shopping "game".

## HW3: Simple 21
This is a simplified version of a common card game, "21". Blackjack is a better-known variant.

## HW4: Pick 


r Letters
This is the game *Pick Your Letters*, which is a game that involves re-arranging a group of cards in order to make up a word.

## HW5: Banking System
This involves implementing a bank program that manages bank accounts and
allows for deposits, withdrawals, purchases, sorting bank accounts based on different criteria,
and exporting bank statements.

## HW6: Analysis of Movie & Ratings Data
We analyze data about movies and ratings from the IMDB website and
get to use functions from the pandasmodule for loading, inspecting and querying the data.
Then we perform some operations on joining the data, slicing rows and querying data
using boolean indexing. Next, we use functions in the numpylibrary, and perform
analysis on summarizing data, creating pivot tables and applying aggregate functions to have a
deeper understanding of the data analysis. Finally, we draw two figures based on the
matplotliblibrary.

## HW8: Pig
Pig is a very simple game. Two players take turns; on each turn, a player rolls a six-sided die 
("die" is the singular of "dice") as many times as she wishes, or until she rolls a 6. Each number 
she rolls, except a 6, is added to her score this turn; but if she rolls a 6, her score for this turn is 
zero, and her turn ends. At the end of each turn, the score for that turn is added to the player's 
total score. The first player to reach or exceed 50 wins.

## HW9: Movie Trivia
We deal with representing a movie database using classes and arraylists, with 
the goal of answering some simple movie trivia questions. For example, "what is the name of 
the movie that both Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio acted in?" Or, "what are the movie 
ratings for Rocky I?"

## HW10: Call of Duty
In the game, we serve as a soldier and the mission is destroying a 10x10 enemy 
base. We need to destroy all Targets in the base.

Before the game begins, the program places all targets randomly in such a way that 
no buildings are immediately adjacent to each other, either horizontally, vertically, or 
diagonally.

The player doesn't know where the targets are. The base is initially covered by mist, 
and the initial display of the base to be printed to the console therefore shows a 
10x10 array with a '.' (a period) in every location.

## HW11: Student Management System
We implement a console-based student management 
system. The objective of this assignment is to design a system for students to 
manage their courses. There will be three main user roles in the application: Admin, 
Student, and Professor. 
 
In the student management system,

a) A student can log in to their account, 
view/add/drop courses, check their course schedule, and view grades.

b) A professor can view course information they have, and view the student lists for these courses. 

c) An admin can view course/student/professor lists, and add/delete 
courses/students/professors.
